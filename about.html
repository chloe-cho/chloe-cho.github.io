      <h3>WHO AM I?</h3>
      <p>I'm currently a 3rd year majoring in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota graduating in 2021.
      I have an interest in learning more about full stack web development, database systems, and would like to
      explore app development. I hope to continue to grow my knowledge in more different areas of computer
      science through experiences and the different classes that I will be taking in the future.
